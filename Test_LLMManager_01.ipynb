      "    Your previous response:\n",
      "\n",
      "    To make steamed chicken momo, a traditional Nepali dumpling dish, you will need the following ingredients for the filling:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ground chicken\n",
      "- Finely chopped onions\n",
      "- Minced garlic and ginger\n",
      "- Finely chopped cilantro\n",
      "- Salt and pepper\n",
      "- Soy sauce\n",
      "- Oil\n",
      "\n",
      "For the dough, you will need:\n",
      "\n",
      "- All-purpose flour\n",
      "- Water\n",
      "- Salt\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a simplified step-by-step process to make steamed chicken momo:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prepare the Filling:**\n",
      "   - In a mixing bowl, combine ground chicken, chopped onions, minced garlic and ginger, cilantro, salt, pepper, and a splash of soy sauce.\n",
      "   - Mix the ingredients well until evenly combined.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Prepare the Dough:**\n",
      "   - In a separate bowl, mix all-purpose flour, water, and a pinch of salt to form a smooth dough.\n",
      "   - Knead the dough until it is soft and pliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Assemble the Momos:**\n",
      "   - Roll out small portions of the dough into thin circles.\n",
      "   - Place a spoonful of the chicken filling in the center of each circle.\n",
      "   - Fold and pleat the edges of the circle to seal the momo in a half-moon shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Steam the Momos:**\n",
      "   - Arrange the assembled momos in a steamer lined with cabbage leaves or parchment paper to prevent sticking.\n",
      "   - Steam the momos for about 15-20 minutes until the dough is cooked and the filling is tender.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Serve:**\n",
      "   - Serve the steamed chicken momos hot with a side of dipping sauce made from soy sauce, vinegar, and chili paste.\n",
      "\n",
      "This recipe can be customized with additional seasonings or vegetables to suit your taste preferences. Enjoy your homemade steamed chicken momos!\n",
